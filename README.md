# Pre-read (About the Interview)

You’ll participate in a 60-minute hands-on design interview to build and demo a small application based on a problem shared at the start. Use any language, framework, or database you prefer. LLMs or AI coding assistants (e.g., ChatGPT, Gemini Code Assist, Cursor AI) are allowed, but your ability to reason, design effectively, and explain your code matters most. Have your app running locally and ready to demo.

# Instructions to Candidates

- You have 90 minutes to complete 1 design question
- Use any LLM or AI coding assistant of your choice to help you build the application.
- Your goal is to have the application running locally in your IDE.
- Be creative on how you want to demo your application to the interviewer

# Boostly — boost morale, one kudos at a time

Build a working application that enables college students to recognize their peers, allocate monthly credits, and redeem earned rewards. The platform should encourage appreciation and engagement across student communities — a simple, transparent system for celebrating contributions and converting recognition into tangible value.

Use any language, framework, or database (e.g., Flask/FastAPI, Express, Spring Boot, Django, Go, etc.) of your choice and comfort.

## Core Functionality

- **Recognition**- Allows one student to recognize another and transfer a certain number of credits. Enforce monthly credit limits (e.g., 100 credits per sender). Prevent invalid actions like self-recognition or exceeding balance.
- **Endorsements**- Enables students to endorse an existing recognition entry (like/cheer). Each endorser can endorse a recognition only once.
- **Redemption**- Lets students redeem the credits they’ve received. Convert credits into a fixed-value voucher (e.g., ₹5 per credit). Clear or reset the redeemed balance afterward.

## Deliverables

- Working local API service (any framework).
- `README.md` with setup, run instructions, and endpoint list.
- Sample cURL/Postman requests with example JSON responses.
- If you are using LLMs, save a copy of all the prompts used

***You are using LLMs and they hallucinate. Your ability to explain the code, think logically, and design effectively will be the key focus.***

***Good Luck!***
